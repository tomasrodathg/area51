# Digital signatures
- Experimenting with post-quantum safe signing algorithms. It's likely that the power of quantum computers will open up a market for safer alternatives to the current algorithms used for cryptographic signatures like HS256,RS256,PS256 or some of the elliptical curve algorithms like Edwards25519. As an experiment of feasibility I will use the current standard library for quantum-safe crypto signatures, `liboqs` from `PQCrystals`. - https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.
